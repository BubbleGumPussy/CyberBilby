        <p>When communicating over the internet it’s generally accepted by everyone that encryption is important to transmitting your data securely. But how does this data get from A to B without exposing your data to potential attackers?</p>
<p>In this article I will touch lightly on the different encryption types used and how they can be used together to ensure your keys are exchanged securely.</p>
<h2 id="symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption">Symmetric vs Asymmetric Encryption</h2>
<p>Before talking about how to securely exchange encryption keys you must first understand the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption and what kind of encryption is available.</p>
<p>I will try to explain both of these methodologies as simple as possible.</p>
<h3 id="symmetric">Symmetric</h3>
<p>Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encrypting and decrypting data. It can encrypt large blocks of data quickly and efficiently.</p>
<p>Types of symmetric encryption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>AES</li>
<li>DES</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asymmetric">Asymmetric</h3>
<p>Asymmetric encryption uses different keys for encryption (public key) and decryption (private key) and is typically used on small blocks of data because it is slower than symmetric encryption.</p>
<p>The encryption and decryption key is known as the public and private key-pair.</p>
<p>Types of asymmetric encryption include:</p>
<ul>
<li>RSA</li>
<li>Diffie-Hellman</li>
<li>Elliptic Curve</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-use-one-over-the-other">Why use one over the other?</h2>
<p>Because of the properties of asymmetric encryption it’s very common to use both symmetric and asymmetric encryption for secure communication.</p>
<p>This is done through something known as the key exchange where the public keys are exchanged with each other and the symmetric key is encrypted and sent back.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-this-key-exchange-look-like">What does this Key Exchange look like?</h2>
<p>In this example I am using RSA as the asymmetric and AES encryption as the symmetric encryption.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob both have generated their asymmetric key-pair.</p>
<p><img src="./static/bob-alice-gen-keypair.png" alt="Image1"></p>
<p>To start communication Alice and Bob must first exchange with each other their public asymmetric key:</p>
<p><img src="./static/bob-alice-exch-keypair.png" alt="Image2"></p>
<p>Alice and Bob can now encrypt a message using each others public asymmetric key:</p>
<p><img src="./static/bob-alice-encrypt-key.png" alt="Image3"></p>
<p>Once they have encrypted their message using each others public asymmetric key they can send the message back to each other:</p>
<p><img src="./static/bob-alice-exch-encrypted-key.png" alt="Image4"></p>
<p>Once Alice and Bob have exchanged their encrypted message, they can decrypt the message using their own private asymmetric key:</p>
<p><img src="./static/bob-alice-decrypt-priv-key.png" alt="Image5"></p>
<p>Alice and Bob can use this process to exchange a symmetric key to each other without exposing it to a potential man-in-the-middle.</p>
<p>This concludes the key exchange.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This article breaks down encryption into two types: symmetric, which uses one key for big data, and asymmetric, which uses two keys for smaller data.</p>
<p>By combining these methods, secure communication is achieved. The key exchange process, demonstrated with RSA and AES, shows how public keys are shared safely, ensuring a secure way for parties like Alice and Bob to swap important information.</p>
