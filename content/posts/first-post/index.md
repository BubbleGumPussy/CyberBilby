## Who am I?

I am a student from Victoria, Australia with a keen interest in CyberSec, Programming, Networking & Video Game Modding. I like to learn new things every day and enjoy teaching others what I have learnt.

## What kind of things will I post?

As I learn new things I like to document my journey in the form of technical articles, blogs or tutorials for others to explore and learn.

I like to keep things short and to the point so the content of my articles or tutorials will likely be succinct in nature.

## Summary

There will be lots of content in the form of tech articles and tutorials to come, so stick around and check back regularly!
